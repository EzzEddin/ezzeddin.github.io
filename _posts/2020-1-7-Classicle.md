Sometimes the need of artificial intelligence can be more important than what the human is capable of. One of the main problems we have is interpreting the topic of a content. Here, classicle tries to solve this problem to make you capable of classifying the topic of the article you're reading or writing or even exploring.
Classicle is a combination between class in 'classify' and icle in 'article'. It can classify your article among these classes: business, tech, entertainment, politics, or sport. Here is the demo on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkPFRTR8QfQ) and here as well:

I don't care what you call it --  depression, being lazy, your mind is not balanced with your body, or whatever. I'm writing this to let you know that it is possible for humans not to burnout and here are some tips to get this word behind you.

## Deactivating Facebook
Facebook has become massively full of negative emotions, you open up your news feed and you see tragedies from almost everyone showed or you can see people showing off with whatever celebrations they have and then you may feel small about that -- not achieving what they did. Social media in general has made us, unfortunately, unsocial. This section is actually about deactivating whatever you see is wasting your time especially from social media. I used to use Facebook and I was one of the fewest who followed high-value content and despite of that, I turned it off.

## Don't Wait
I'm the type of person who takes action, you may follow me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ezzeddinabdullah) and noticed even I got a job at Affectiva, that didn't let me satisfied with my achievement in software industry -- it rather pushed me forward and let me proceed with what I was doing with [side projects](https://swkids.netlify.app) beyond working hours and at the weekend. Don't let yourself feel you're waiting for something to happen and then you settle down, start doing some stuff and stick to it no matter what level you've been to. 

## A Positive and Growth Mindset
If we can make a definition to a mindset, we can say it's a collection of stories that we tell ourselves. What we say to ourselves matter a lot so don't let any negative voice you tell yourself affect you. Just don't see yourself as a victim and don't complain. Think positive always.

## Treat Yourself Like Someone You Care About
This is rule 2 in __12 Rules for Life__ book by Jordan Peterson. He was talking about that we ourselves deserve some respect. 
> You deserve some respect. You are important to other people as much as to yourself. You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world. You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don't end up resentful, vengeful, and cruel. Don't understimate the power of vision and direction. These are irresistible forces, able to transform what might appear to be unconquerable obstacles into traversable pathways and expanding opportunities. Start with yourself. Take care of yourself. Define who you are. Refine your personality. Choose your destination and articulate your being.

## Set Goals (The `Why`)
You have to set goals which are realistic and short-termed unlike vision which is something too optimistic and long-term. Ask yourself `why` when you do something -- it's  not about `how` we will be doing this project or this business. It's about the `why` and if you don't recognize and answer such question why you're doing what you're doing, sorry you're gonna be lost and give up. Don't let that happen and be sure to know the reason behind what you're doing.

## Have Belief
Six months ago, the world was completely different. Every mosque, church, club, coffee shop was open -- every thing. Out of the blue, this coronavirus acted aggressively and let us all at home. If you have faith, I believe you are still alive and have the stamina and hope that all of this will pass away and we'll get through this period soon or later. Same goes with yourself, if you feel you have any stress due to work or this pandemic; just believe that there is The Almighty, The Creator who made us from nothing can make all that stressful feeling pass away, and then believe in yourself -- that you can be somebody who can't listen to the majority and fill your ear with so much negativity unconsiousley.

## Build Habits
Slowly build something substantial by doing small bits day by day. Workout even for 10 minutes a day. Read some for 15 minutes or so.  What's incredible about moving forward and being consistent, even little things, is that you have long-term habits that you can do everyday without feeling stressed when doing it, because you can do it like brushing your teeth -- something you're used to and committed to do.

## Conclusion
I'm not saying I didn't burnout in the past because I did already but very few compared to the majority. My goal with this article is to make you think about removing `burnout` from your dictionary if you still have it. Build upon your dictionary with a list of positive words instead of some illusional vocab.

When it comes to presentating anything to your audience, this mean

sometimes people are lazy to get their pictures 

just put a headline and then a picture 
## use more pictures than words
it could be harder to get their feeling out 
people listen to what we're saying and it could be much better if they see something 

How to Present Your Ideas in a Beautiful Way

A Picture is Worth a 1000 Words

One element for your consideration is the use of images for conveying ideas. The axiom: ‘a picture is worth a 1000 words’ can actually work. You may not be able to convey everything with an image but it can give you a jump start. Of a similar nature are prototypes. They may not be perfect in their representation but they provide a starting point. The key is to use something familiar that provides a backdrop you can later on additional details.

For example. If you had an idea for a better messaging app you could create a prototype of the app to show the new features or create some pictures (or a video) that showed what the app could do.

Hope these ideas are some you can add to your toolkit.

## Tell a Story
Be concrete to let people understand

    2.3.1 Story Telling
        Just like Steve Jobs said: no big deal, three stories.
        Everyone started to listen to stories since they’re kids, they can never reject a vivid story.


## Ensure that the presentation is legible from anywhere in the room

Do not use fonts or graphics that cannot be comfortably understood from the back of the room. Most experts recommend not using a font size smaller than 28 points. If you find yourself needing to go below 28, you have too much text on each slide.

## Involve the audience in the presentation

Whether your goal is to inform or to persuade, the goal will be more likely met if the audience has a participative role in the presentation. People don’t like to be talked to – they like to be talked with. Include questions for the audience. Solicit opinions and experiences from the audience. Turn the presentation into a guided discussion with visual support.

## Prepare a dedicated handout
you don't know where your audience are consuming your slides .. many scenariors you can imagine 

Rather than giving out a copy of the presentation, prepare a dedicated handout that includes a combination of the most important visuals from the presentation with the most important words from the speech. Written in full sentence narrative, this handout would be able to stand alone and would still make sense to the audience, three months after the presentation. For some presentations, this handout might be a simple as a one page summary of the presentation. For other presentations, it might be a full white paper that includes the supporting data that led to the arguments made in the presentation.

## Do not use PowerPoint for reasons it is not intended

A slide is intended to augment a speaker – it is not intended to stand alone and serve as a document. PowerPoint slides should be viewed as ephemeral – only existing while the speaker is talking. A PowerPoint presentation is not supposed to be a permanent documentation of a topic.

There are many TED talks that do not need slides. Make sure you use visuals, animations.
## Do not present too much information

Designers 

Dating back to Aristotle, speakers have known that an audience will only walk away remembering a few ideas from a speech. Aristotle called this the “Rule of Three”. Pick three ideas you want to present and present those. Each of those might be broken into three parts to explain, but don’t bother adding a fourth main point, because they won’t remember it. For a modern example, look at the Apple presentations given by Steve Jobs – they were always structured around the “Rule of Three”.

Here is the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHx_LaP4TuY&feature=youtu.be) on my youtube channel, would love to see your like and subscribe to see more projects coming up.

## Do not add content unless it supports your main points

The slide is a canvas used to paint your story. There should be nothing on the slide that is not working to tell the story. Extraneous details in templates, graphs, figures, and tables should be removed. The process of absorbing and using information is called cognitive loading. Extraneous details use up cognitive load and make it harder for the audience to follow along and learn.

## Do not use PowerPoint as a teleprompter

Do not read your slides to the audience. Do not fill your slides with everything you need to say. Do not make the audience question what value you, the speaker, is adding to the presentation. The slides are for the audience, not the speaker. If something is on a slide, it is because it is needed to understand what the speaker is saying.

## Use PowerPoint to clarify and amplify your message

The purpose of projecting an image on the wall, adjacent to the person speaking, is to provide a visual representation of the topics being spoken of. The visuals are to augment, not repeat, the words of the speaker. Slides should convey graphically what words cannot. If the words are so straightforward that they need no clarification or amplification, then don’t use slides.

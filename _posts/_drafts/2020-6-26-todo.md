points:
- importance of text files
will save you from the hassle of getting your stuff imported from another app you no longer use

- linux, mac, download for windows
- features and benefits
get stuff quickly, search easily
- codes

touch todo.sh
#configuration
touch .todo
vim todo.sh
#type description
./todo.sh
chmod +x ./todo.sh
./todo.sh
you don't have to type that everytime, you can just type t or something depending on your choice by just aliasing that ./todo.sh into t
in .bashrc
alias t='./todo.sh'

Whether there is a need to know how many people are in a certain area or an event or in a car, or in surveillance applications and more, Reck can help detect faces in a picture. Reck is capable of detecting one face or multiple faces and can also recognize if there are no faces at all. I've named it Reck because it means care and I do care about knowing people.

Here is the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHx_LaP4TuY&feature=youtu.be) on my youtube channel, would love to see your like and subscribe to see more projects coming up.
